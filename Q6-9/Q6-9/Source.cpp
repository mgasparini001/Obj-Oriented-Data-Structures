1. My planning and prioritizing impacted my ability to complete
questlog 3 on time in several ways. One positive step 
I took was looking at the quests and starting to work on them two weeks before 
they were due to give myself plenty of time. One mistake I made was spending too much time on quest 3.9 and 3.3, and part of why this 
happened was because i didnt write out the logic for the program before i started coding it all

2. The dangers of working too close to the deadline are running into bugs that are hard to fix
last minute, or external circumstances popping up that could prevent you from having enough time to finish.

3. 5 consequences of poor time management/working 
too close to deadline on your life and career are:
	1) financial loss for the project due to not completing it
	2) Not being viewed well by your superiors, not being able to advance, getting fired
	3) frustration/discontent with your work
	4) Always being in a rush to complete tasks, never being able to slow down and rest
	5) completing projects that are done sloppily due to rushing the work in last minute
It hurts your relationships with collegues, peers, and others in contexts where they expect
you to have something done and are relying on for it.

4.  1) Having a calendar system in some way, that places tasks for you with a reasonable
time buffer to give you time to complete the task. This will constantly remind you what
needs to be done next, so the tasks to do wont leave your mind until you actually do them.
	2) Taking break intervals in between work sessions, as well as having a consistent work 
routine, so that you avoid burnout which leads to long periods of pushing off work.
